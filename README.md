# FlowAPI Builder

FlowAPI Builder is an interactive visual tool that enables developers to rapidly build REST APIs and backend applications using a flow-based interface. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and intuitive visual programming, FlowAPI Builder dramatically reduces the time required to design, develop, and deploy backend services.

## Features

- **Visual API Design**: Create REST endpoints by connecting nodes in an intuitive flow interface
- **LLM-Powered Development**: Leverage AI to generate code, suggest optimizations, and solve complex problems
- **Database Integration**: Easily connect to databases with visual schema design and query building
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure access controls with pre-built components
- **Code Export**: Generate production-ready code in your preferred language and framework
